# User Management

A project focused on user management, designed to streamline user-related operations and functionality.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The **User Management** project consists of a backend API, a frontend web application, and a database. The backend handles user authentication, and CRUD operations, while the frontend provides an intuitive interface for interacting with the system.

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status

- **Backend**: Fully functional with a complete API.
- **Frontend**: Work in progress.
- This README will be updated as the project evolves.

## ðŸ”§ Setup and Run

To get started, ensure you have Docker installed. Then, simply run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will spin up the backend, frontend, and database services, all configured and ready to use.

## ðŸ“¡ Testing the API with Postman

You can test the API using the provided Postman collection. Follow these steps:

1. Import the Postman collection located in *backend/postman/user_management.postman_collection.json*.

2. Log in first using the Login User request. Authentication is required to access other user-related endpoints.

3. Once logged in, copy the received authentication token and use it for subsequent requests.

4. Explore and test the various API endpoints.
